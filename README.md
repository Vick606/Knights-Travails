# Knight's Tour Visualizer

## Overview

Welcome to the Knight's Tour Visualizer! This project, part of The Odin Project curriculum, brings the classic chess puzzle to life. Watch as a knight traverses the chessboard, finding the shortest path between any two squares.

## Features

- Interactive 8x8 chessboard
- Visualize the shortest path a knight can take between any two squares
- Animated path display
- Responsive design for various screen sizes

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Webpack
- Font Awesome for icons

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies. 
4. Start dev server.
5. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:8080`

## How It Works

The Knight's Tour Visualizer uses a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path between two squares on a chessboard. Here's a brief overview of the process:

1. The chessboard is represented as a graph, where each square is a node.
2. Valid knight moves are calculated for each square.
3. BFS traverses the graph to find the shortest path.
4. The path is animated on the chessboard for visualization.

## Lessons Learned

This project reinforced several key programming concepts:

- Graph theory and its practical applications
- Breadth-First Search algorithm implementation
- DOM manipulation for dynamic visualizations
- Asynchronous JavaScript for animations
- Webpack configuration for modern web development

## Future Enhancements

- Add option to visualize all possible knight's tours from a given starting position
- Implement different chess piece movements (e.g., rook, bishop)
- Add a difficulty setting to challenge users to find the path themselves
